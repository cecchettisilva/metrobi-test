Feature: Create delivery management
    As a Metrobi user
    I want to create a new delivery
    So I can manage deliveries

Background:
 	Given I am logged in as an authorized user
    And I am on the Metrobi dashboard

Scenario: Access the "Copy quote link" on the delivery
	When I access the "My Deliveries" page 
    And I access a delivery in progress 
    Then I should be on the "Delivery details" page
	When I click the "icon-dots-vertical" button
    And I click the "Copy quote link" button
    And I open the copied link in a new browser tab
    Then the "Add payment method" page should be displayed
    When I return to the "My Deliveries" browser tab
    Then the "Delivery details" page should be displayed

# ================================
# Bug 2:
# When an emergency contact is added to a delivery, the system accepts the action but the contact is not displayed on the "Delivery details" page.
# The expected behavior is that the added emergency contact should be displayed somewhere on the delivery details page.
# ================================

Scenario: Add an emergency contact to the delivery
	When I access the "My Deliveries" page 
    And I access a delivery in progress 
    Then I should be on the "Delivery details" page
	When I click the "icon-dots-vertical" button
    And I click the "Add emergency contact" button
    Then I select an emergency contact from the list 
    And I click the "Add" button
    Then the emergency contact should be displayed on the "Delivery details" page
